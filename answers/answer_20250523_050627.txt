Réponse: Charles Perrault est un homme qui a vécu pendant plusieurs années au XVIIème siècle à Paris. Il était une personne riche et bien éduquée. Il a fait ses études pour devenir avocat puis il s'est lancé dans la carrière publique.

Il a été membre des Académies de Sciences et d'Inscriptions-Belles Littératures ainsi que de l'Academie Francaise où il a été élu en 1671. Sa vie privée comprend également sa relation avec Marie Guichon, qu'il épousa en 1672 avant qu'elle ne décède deux ans plus tard. 

Son œuvre littéraire inclut diverses œuvres comme les Tales of Mother Goose, dont elle est connue aujourd'hui sous ce titre, et The Adventures of Pinocchio. Son dernier livre était Saint-Paulin, Evêque de Nolte. Malgré cela, il est surtout connu pour avoir écrit ces histoires, qui sont maintenant très populaires auprès des enfants. De plus, après sa mort, en 1703, il a été honnie par Google lors d'une publicité.

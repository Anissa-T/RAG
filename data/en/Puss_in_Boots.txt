"Puss in Boots" (German:Der gestiefelte Kater;French:Le Maître chat ou le Chat botté;Italian:Il gatto con gli stivali;Dutch:De Gelaarsde Kat) is a Europeanfairy taleabout ananthropomorphiccatwho uses trickery and deceit to gain power, wealth, and the hand in marriage of a princess for his penniless and low-born master.
The oldest written telling versionCostantino Fortunato(Italian for "Lucky Costantino") by Italian authorGiovanni Francesco Straparola, included inThe Facetious Nights of Straparola(c.1550–1553), in which the cat is a fairy in disguise who helps his owner, a poor boy named Costantino fromBohemia, to gain his princess by duping a king, a lord, and many commoners.[1][2]There is a version written by Girolamo Morlini, from whom Straparola used various tales inThe Facetious Nights;[3]another version was published in 1634 byGiambattista Basilewith the titleCagliuso. The most popular version of the tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century byCharles Perrault(1628–1703), a retired civil servant and member of theAcadémie française.[4]
Puss in Bootsappears inDreamWorks'Shrekfranchise, appearing in all three sequels to theoriginal film, as well as two spin-off films,Puss in Boots(2011) andPuss in Boots: The Last Wish(2022), where he is voiced byAntonio Banderas. The character is signified in the logo of Japanese anime studioToei Animation, and is also a popularpantomimein the UK.
Infolkloristics,Puss in Bootsis classified asAarne–Thompson–UtherATU 545B, "Puss in Boots", a subtype of ATU 545, "The Cat as Helper".[5]FolkloristsJoseph JacobsandStith Thompsonpoint that the Perrault tale is the possible source of the Cat Helper story in later European folkloric traditions.[6][7]Similarly, Frisian professorJurjen van der Kooinoted that variants from oral tradition were only starting to be recorded from the 19th century onwards, and tales fromCentralandWestern Europefollow Perrault's and Grimm's redaction very closely.[8]In the same vein, French folkloristsPaul DelarueandMarie-Louise Ténèze, editors of the French Folktale Catalogue, concur that oral variants where the cat appears as the helper (especially those in which he wears boots) were influenced by Perrault's tale.[9]
According to scholars (e.g., van der Kooi,Hans-Jörg Uther, Stith Thompson andInes Köhler-Zülch), while the cat appears mostly in Europe as the animal helper, variants across cultures replace the cat with a jackal, a fox or another species of animal,[10][11][12][13]like a dog, a rooster, or an ape.[14]German folklorist Köhler-Zulch noted the geographical distribution of the different animal helpers: a fox inEasternandSoutheastern Europe, as well in the Caucasus andCentral Asia; and an ape, a jackal or a gazelle inSouthern Asia[15]and in Africa.[16]For instance, professorDamiana Eugenioremarked that the helpful animal is a monkey "in all Philippine variants".[17]
In the Hungarian National Catalogue of Folktales (MNK), in tale type 545B,A csizmás kandúr("The (Tom)cat with boots"), the protagonist may be helped either by a cat or a rooster received from his father as his inheritance, or rescues a fox from peril (e.g., starvation or hunters), and the animal promises to help him in return.[18]
According to Swedish scholarWaldemar Liungman[sv], a cycle of tales that developed in Northern Europe involves thespirit of a dead maninstead of a cat. This cycle is found inDenmark,FinlandandEstonia.[19]
French folklorists Paul Delarue and Marie-Louise Ténèze, editors of the French Folktale Catalogue, argued that the existence of variants with a helpful fox instead of a cat indicate an "oral tradition [that is] independent from the printed versions". As such, they locate such variants in, besides some tales in France, peninsular Italy, in Sicily, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Finland, Turkey and Mongolia.[20]
According to the description of the tale type in theEast SlavicFolktale Catalogue (Russian:СУС,romanized:SUS), last updated by scholarLev Barag[ru]in 1979, the hero may be helped either by a cat (Russian:кот), or by a fox (Russian:лиса).[21]Similarly, theBulgarianFolktale Catalogue names type 545B asВоденичарят и лисицата("The Miller and the Fox").[22][23]
In theTypen türkischer Volksmärchen("Turkish Folktale Catalogue"), byWolfram EberhardandPertev Naili Boratav, both scholars listed the variants with the fox as the animal helper under Turkish type TTV 34,Der Müller und der Fuchs("The Miller and the Fox"), which corresponds in the international classification to tale type ATU 545B.[24]
Hungarian orientalistLászló L. Lőrinczestablished the classification of theMongoliantale corpus. In his system, the story appears as type 32,Der Dank des schlauen roten Fuchs("The grateful, slyred fox"), in two variations: the fox replaces the cat as the protagonist's helper; the protagonist either hunts the fox himself and releases it (variation "A"), or he hides the fox from a hunter (variation "B"); in return, the red fox helps the protagonist marry a khan's daughter.[25]
Tales of the Caucasian Region also register the fox in the place of the cat. For example, Georgian scholarship registers tale type ATU 545B inGeorgia, with the name "The Fox and the Peasant", wherein the cat is replaced by the helpful fox.[26]Similarly, in the index ofAdyghefolktale corpus, a fox helps a poor carpenter to marry the daughter of aknyaz(lord),[27]and in theAzerbaijaniFolktale Index, in Azeri type 545B,Armudan bəy, the fox helps the miller's son in marrying the padishah's daughter.[28]
The tale has also spread to the Americas, and is known in Asia (India, Indonesia and Philippines).[29]Greek scholar Marianthi Kaplanoglou states that the tale type ATU 545B, "Puss in Boots" (or, locally, "The Helpful Fox"), is an "example" of "widely known stories (...) in the repertoires of Greek refugees from Asia Minor".[30]
The saying "enough to make a cat laugh" dates from the mid-1800s and is associated with the tale of Puss in Boots.[31]
The Bibliothèque de Carabas[32]book series was published byDavid Nuttin London in the late 19th century, in which the front cover of each volume depicts Puss in Boots reading a book.
